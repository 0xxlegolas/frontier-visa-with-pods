   *

   *     https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/react/packages/client/src/mud/setupNetwork.ts#L77-L83).
   *
   * - From the second parameter, which is a ClientComponent,
   *   we only care about Counter. This parameter comes to use
   *   through createClientComponents.ts, but it originates in
   *   syncToRecs
   *   (https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/react/packages/client/src/mud/setupNetwork.ts#L77-L83).
